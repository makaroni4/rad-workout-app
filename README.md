## Description

RAD (Reactive Agility Drill) is a simple workout app built with Vue.js. It was inspired by a [Youtube video by TappBrothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eyNh8_MGF4&t=540s) and basically acts as a partner in a workout – gives you random directions to follow and perform excercies: jump for UP, squat or push up for DOWN, side step & dip down for LEFT/RIGHT.
